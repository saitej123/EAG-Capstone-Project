"""Stage 1 & 2: extract content, then build a per-slide lesson + HTML view.

Redesigned for tight audio/video sync:

* Content is modelled as a list of *slides*, each with its own ``narration``
  text, an optional flowchart, and the active step to highlight. This lets the
  media pipeline synthesize one audio clip per slide and time each video
  segment to that clip exactly (no global autoplay timer that drifts).
* A single self-contained HTML file renders ONE slide at a time, selected via
  ``?slide=N``. There is no autoplay; the capture worker drives navigation so a
  slide is only ever shown while its narration is playing.

The HTML is intentionally *designed* like a real lecture: rotating per-slide
color themes, a hero intro scene, animated numbered content cards, a device
framed diagram, a YouTube-style caption bar, and a top progress bar.

TEACHING GOALS (every slide must serve these):
- CONCEPT FIRST: name the idea, give a concrete analogy or tiny example, then
  the mechanism. Prefer "what it is → why it matters → how it works" over lists
  of facts. If the source is dense, unpack one mechanism per slide.
- RICH BUT SCANNABLE: on-screen text is short labels; narration carries depth
  (intuition, trade-offs, pitfalls, "so what?"). Never leave a slide with only
  one sparse line — fill the visual with 3–6 animated items when it fits.
- ANIMATION-READY: multi-item layouts (flow, steps, hub, bars, compare, stat)
  animate item-by-item in sync with the voice. Put items in the SAME ORDER the
  narration explains them so highlights feel intentional.
- FAITHFUL: invent no results, numbers, or citations. Use only what the source
  supports (or clearly mark as general intuition when teaching).

LAYOUT MENU — pick the BEST layout per slide from the full variety pack (up to
~20 distinct visual beats across a long video). Do NOT reuse the same layout on
consecutive slides. Prefer rich animated layouts over a string of bullets.
Only include the field that matches the chosen layout:
  * "hook"      -> kinetic cold-open number. Fill "hook" with
    {{value, label, punchline}}. Prefer slide 1 when there is a striking cost,
    scale, risk, or result.
  * "bars"      -> animated magnitude bars. Fill "bars" with
    {{title, items:[{{label, value (0-100), note}}]}} (2-5 items). Pricing,
    scale, effort, share-of-attention.
  * "bullets"   -> 3-4 short takeaways (each a concrete fact/mechanism/example).
  * "stat"      -> 1-3 big metrics {{value,label}} (results, benchmarks, sizes).
  * "compare"   -> two sides; left/right titles + 2-4 points each (old vs new,
    approach A vs B, myth vs reality). Also use for do/don't pitfalls.
  * "steps"     -> 3-6 ordered actions / timeline beats the viewer can follow.
  * "quote"     -> ONE pivotal insight sentence in "quote".
  * "hub"       -> one center concept + 3-7 satellite nodes {{label, sub}}.
    Parts of a system, facets of an idea, "the N pillars".
  * "panel"     -> terminal/code/config mock: title, subtitle, optional badge,
    "lines" of short commands/config. Great for APIs, prompts, CLI, schemas.
  * "transform" -> messy/raw "from" becomes clean "to" structure (from_title,
    from_note, to_center, to_nodes, footer).
  * "flow"      -> linked pipeline with arrows. orientation "horizontal" (2-4)
    or "vertical" (3-6); steps [{{label, sub}}]. Use whenever stages are
    causal/sequential so the video SHOWS linkage, not just a list.
  * "matrix"    -> 2×2 or 2×3 articulated cards. Fill "matrix" with
    {{items:[{{label, detail}}]}} (3–4 items). Use for claim/evidence,
    components, trade-offs, checklist facets — denser than bullets, still
    scannable. Prefer this when the source has several parallel facts.
  * "bento"     -> 3–5 tiles (first tile is the hero). Geometry change, not a
    color swap. Fill "bullets" with short tile labels.
  * "cards"     -> 2–5 stacked cards from "bullets" (offset deck, not a list).
  * "rail"      -> 3–5 numbered stations on a path from "bullets" or "steps".
  * "spotlight" -> one lead line + supporting chips. Use for a single insight
    with 1–3 supporting facts in "bullets".
  * "diagram"   -> process map; set show_flowchart true + active_node.
  * "cover"     -> ONLY when instructed for research papers/books (first page).
SMART FIT: match slide LAYOUT to content — numbers→hook/stat/bars; systems→hub/flow;
trade-offs→compare/matrix; how-to→steps/rail; tiles→bento/cards; insight→quote/spotlight;
code→panel; cleanup→transform. Rotate through the menu so a 10–20 slide lesson uses
many GEOMETRIES (bento vs rail vs split vs stack) — not the same cards recolored.
Do NOT invent or swap the presentation visual style, color theme, or voice —
those are locked by Studio / the user.

FORMAT TARGET ({format_label} / {platform} · {aspect_ratio}):
{format_guidance}
Style template cue: {style_template}

STORY ARC ({style_label} — follow this structure closely):
{story_arc}
Produce EXACTLY {slide_count} slides (not fewer) so runtime hits ~{target_minutes}.
FIRST: cold-open hook (or cover when required) unless the style arc says
otherwise. LAST: a crisp recap / takeaways slide unless the style is a pure
short hook. Prefer flow/steps/matrix for sequential or multi-facet ideas;
reserve diagram for genuine process maps.

FLOWCHART: one Mermaid `flowchart TD` of the whole process (ids A,B,C…;
short labels). Highlight via active_node on diagram slides only.

NARRATION (spoken aloud — no markup, no emojis, no stage directions):
- {words_per_slide_min}–{words_per_slide_max} words per slide (target
  ~{words_per_slide}). TOTAL across all slides ≈ {total_words} words
  (~{target_minutes} at a calm pace). Do NOT exceed the max.
- Explain THIS slide's concept clearly: intuition → mechanism → takeaway.
  Tie each spoken beat to an on-screen item in order (first sentence ≈ first
  bullet/step/node) so animation highlights feel synced.
- HUMANIZE the voice: sound like a real person teaching on camera — warm,
  clear, slightly imperfect rhythm. Use contractions (it's, you'll, don't),
  short asides ("here's the twist", "watch this part"), and one concrete
  micro-example when it helps. Prefer "you" / "we" over "one" / "the user".
- Vary sentence length. Start some slides mid-thought ("So the trick is…").
  End teaching slides with a crisp "so what" line the viewer can repeat.
- Never corporate-AI, brochure, or textbook-lecture tone. Never stack three
  abstract nouns ("scalability resilience architecture").
- Ban AI-slop words: delve, landscape, leverage, unlock, game-changer,
  furthermore, moreover, robust solution, cutting-edge, embark, tapestry,
  pivotal, nuanced, holistic, seamless, empower.
- Do NOT read bullets verbatim. Do NOT say "lesson", "welcome back",
  "in this video", or "as we can see from the slide".
- Title/recap slides shorter; teaching slides denser. No filler or padding.

ON-SCREEN COPY (what the HTML slideshow shows — must feel human, not a dump):
- Headings: punchy, specific, spoken-aloud friendly (not "Overview" /
  "Introduction" / "Key Points" unless truly needed). Prefer a claim or question.
- Bullets/steps/nodes: ultra-short labels packed with meaning; each item
  distinct. Prefer concrete nouns/verbs ("cache miss", "retry once") over
  vague adjectives ("important", "better", "efficient").
- Caption-ready phrasing: labels should make sense if read alone under the
  visual. No orphan jargon without a tiny context word.
- Never marketing fluff, never wall-of-text paragraphs on the board.

ON-SCREEN FIT (critical — overcrowding / overlap is a failure):
- Cap density: ≤4 bullets, ≤4 matrix cells, ≤5 hub nodes, ≤4 flow steps,
  ≤4 transform chips, ≤4 compare items per side, ≤5 steps.
- Labels ≤ ~6 words; card details ≤ one short line. Leave ≥16px breathing room.
- One idea per slide. Prefer splitting content across two slides over cramming.
- Choose the RIGHT rich layout (flow/hub/compare/stat/panel/bars/matrix) —
  fill with structure, not with more text. Empty space beats overlapping text.

MATH: preserve real LaTeX in "equations" as {{"label","tex"}} (tex WITHOUT $).
Inline math in bullets/headings with $...$. Narration says formulas in words.
Use \\\\lt / \\\\gt instead of < / > inside math.
